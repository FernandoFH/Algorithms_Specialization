### Algorithms Specialization
##### Stanford University

1. Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms
  - Asymptotic ("Big-oh") notation
  - Sorting and searching
  - Divide and conquer (master method, integer and matrix multiplication, closest pair)
  - Randomized algorithms (QuickSort, contraction algorithm for min cuts).

2. Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures
  - Data structures (heaps, balanced search trees, hash tables, bloom filters)
  - Graph primitives (applications of breadth-first and depth-first search, connectivity, shortest paths)
  - Their applications (ranging from deduplication to social network analysis).

3. Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming
 - Greedy algorithms (scheduling, minimum spanning trees, clustering, Huffman codes) 
 - Dynamic programming (knapsack, sequence alignment, optimal search trees).

4. Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About Them
 - Shortest paths (Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, Johnson)
 - NP-completeness and what it means for the algorithm designer
 - Strategies for coping with computationally intractable problems (analysis of heuristics, local search).
